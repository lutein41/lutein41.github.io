## About Me
I studied Biology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. After obtaining a Bachelor's in Biology, I accepted a research technician position at the Plants for Human Health Insitute(PHHI). While working there, I became fascinated with using computer programs to do science research. I started taking computer science classes as a post-bachelor student and was accepted into the master's program in computer science at Georgia Tech.
