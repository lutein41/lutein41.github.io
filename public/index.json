After obtaining a Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s in Biology, I accepted a research technician position at the Plants for Human Health Insitute(PHHI). While working there, I became fascinated with using computer programs to do science research. I started taking computer science classes as a post-bachelor student and was accepted into the master\u0026rsquo;s program in computer science at Georgia Tech.\nEducation MS in Computer Sciecne, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2018-2011 BA in Biology, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, 2010-2014 ","date":null,"permalink":"/about/about/","section":"Abouts","summary":"About Me I studied Biology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.","title":""},{"content":"OCCBio System Individual Project Application Designer: Ryan Park Software Developer: Ryan Park\nQ/A Tester: Ryan Park\nProgramming Language: Java(1.8) and SQL\nBuild Tool: Maven\nIDE: IntelliJ Community\nDatabase:\nRelational Database Management System: MySQL(8) Storage Engine: InnoDB Testing:\nUnit Testing: JUnit5 Integration Testing: video INTORUDCTION For Anatomy and Physiology(AP) students, scientific human anatomy models are essential visual studying tools. However, I noticed that students can access these tools only during their lab period, which is about one and a half hours. Although students can lend the models at the college library, the library only has a small number of AP models. It would benefit students if the Biology department lent the models to students before exams. To identify the user\u0026rsquo;s goals, problems, needs, requirements, and potential stakeholders, I used observation, semi-structured interviews, and research as my need-finding activity. After the needfinding activity, I designed a relational database model based on the user\u0026rsquo;s requirements for a desktop application.\n1. NEEDFINDING 1.1 Interview I developed semi-structured interview questions for instructors, librarians, and students. My core questions were asked for all participants, but each participant was asked different probing questions.\nShould our department lend the models to students?\nWho should be responsible for lending models (for instructors only)?\nWhich checkout system do you prefer: digitalized form or paper form?\nHow often do you lend the models from our library? (for students only)\nHow do you use a paper model checkout form at the library (for librarians only)?\na.\tCan you explain to me why we use a paper form?\nb.\tAre you happy about using a paper form?\nc.\tWhat would you do if you lost the form?\nd.\tCan you tell me which models are popular?\\\nI interviewed two instructors, one librarian, and three students.\n1.2 Research I searched news articles about the advantages and disadvantages of paper receipts over digital receipts. After reading some articles, I concluded that using a digital system for lending models is much better than using a paper checkout form. Here are some of the advantages of using a digital system:\nYou can avoid losing a paper checkout form.\nYou can manage inventory and students digitally.\nYou can use SQL database language to store and process information in a database. You can also use SQL for data analytics. For example, a lab manager might want to know which models are popular so that the manager can order more.\\\nSources of news articles :\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/23/paper-or-email-pros-and-cons-of-digital-receipts.html\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/11/03/retailers-e-mail-digital-paperless-receipts/1675069/\n1.3 Problem Statement From the needfinding activity, First, I concluded that students want to borrow models especially for their exams. Although one instructor states that young students (early 20s) prefer to use 3D software to observe human structures, 1/3 of students in AP classes are not young and like physical models. Students also like physical models for group discussion. Second, lab staff choose a digital system over a paper checkout form.\n2.
